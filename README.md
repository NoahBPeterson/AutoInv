# AutoInv

This is a recreation of the AutoInventory plugin, which automatically places all blocks in the inventory (if they drop something) that are mined with a tool. There is one corresponding command, "/dropwhenfull". By default, if a player mines a block and the block cannot be added to the inventory, it is dropped. By using /dropswhenfull, these extra blocks are destroyed.
